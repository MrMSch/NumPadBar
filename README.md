## Description

NumPadBar is a World of Warcraft Addon for an action bar in the shape of a numpad. It works like a built-in action bar such as the Bottom Right ActionBar, for example. You can drag actions and macros into and out of NumPadBar, just like other action bars.

The first major difference between NumPadBar and built-in action bars is that it is in the shape of a numpad. Also, keybindings for numpad keys are already set up for the numpad bar. These keybindings are temporary and are only used while the numpad is displayed.

The second major difference is that NumPadBar can be used as a normal action bar or as a stance bar. When using it as a normal action bar, the same actions are used no matter what stance you are in. When using it as a stance bar, the actions will change depending on your stance; they will be the same actions that are in the built-in stance bar.

You can move NumPadBar anywhere on screen. You can change its size. You can choose from a selection of popular keyboards; this affects the layout of the numpad keys. You can hide NumPadBar. You can hide the labels on the keys. You can select whether to display the Enter key (and override Chat binding), and whether to display the cursor keys (and override movement and other bindings).

In the heat of combat, it is all too easy to accidentally drag actions out of action bars. Therefore, NumPadBar, as well as the built-in action bars, are locked during combat. This prevents all changes to NumPadBar during combat.

You can display instructions in a scrollable tooltip by right-clicking the invisible background of NumPadBar near the numeric keys and selecting Help.
